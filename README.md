# FreeCodeCamp.org Course on Terraform

This is the code for the FreeCamp.org Terraform Tutorial.

Here I will add all the source code for the course as well as all the improvements that I will make while learning the subject.

I will also use this repo as a central piece of knowledge, adding all the trust resources that I will use in the journey.
